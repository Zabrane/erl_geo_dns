geo_dns : a simple geoip dns server

geo_dns uses the maxmind geoip db to determine which ip associated with a dns record is the closest to the requesters ip address and serves that up as the ip address for the requested domain


author : joe williams <joe@joetify.com>


license : apache 2


building/starting : 

$ sudo apt-get install libgeoip-dev libgeoip1 erlang couchdb

* download geoip db, http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCity.dat.gz

$ git clone git@github.com:joewilliams/erl_geo_dns.git

$ cd erl_geo_dns
$ make
$ erl -pa apps/*/ebin -s geo_dns

* for non-defaults adjust apps/geo_dns/ebin/geo_dns.app for the configuration (port, geo db, etc) you would like


creating records:

* each dns record is a document in couchdb (on localhost by default). the document format is the following:

_id : "test.com"
iplist : [[a,b,c,d],[a,b,c,d]]
ttl : 300

* note that the iplist field is an array of arrays where ip address octets are items in the internal arrays


caveats:

* this server has never been used in production and is mostly a proof of concept
* only supports A records
